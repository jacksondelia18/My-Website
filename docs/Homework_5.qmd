Homework 5


```{r}
################
###Create a funtion that takes the parameters 
# required to run a logistic growth model and 
# returns a dataframe with columns for population size and time.

Nt <- function(N0 = 10, r = 0.1, K = 200, tf = 100, ts = 1) {
#define function that finds Nt

  t <- seq(from = 1, to = tf, by = ts)
  e <- 2.7183
  N <- K/(1+((K-N0)/N0)*e^(-r*t))
#set variables needed for equation and run it

  df <- data.frame(t, N)
  #turns the output into a data frame

return(df)
}


LogGrowth <- Nt()
#name this data frame output function for later use

################
```


Question 2


Make a function which creates a plot


```{r}
################
plot <- function(df = LogGrowth){

  library(ggplot2) #call up ggplot
  LogGrowth |>
      ggplot(aes(x=t, y=N))+
    geom_point()+
    labs(
      x = "Time in Years", 
      y = "Population Size") +
    theme_minimal()
#plug the aformentioned LogGrowth data frame into a graph.
#name the axes.
#I like the minimal theme :^)

}
plot()
################
```
